# Anime-Sorting-Hat

## Overview

This Python script helps you organize your anime files based on a specific naming convention: `[GroupName] Anime Name S#- S##E##.mkv`. The script detects the anime name and season number (if available) from each file name and organizes them into respective directories. If there's no season number, it places the files directly into the main anime directory.

## Features

- **Organize by Anime Name**: Files are categorized by the extracted anime name.
- **Season Subfolders**: Files with season numbers (`S#` or `S##E##`) are placed in corresponding season subdirectories.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Place `.mkv` files in the same directory.
4. Run the script: `Anime-Sorting-Hat.py`.
5. Verify the organized directories.

## File Naming Convention

- Anime files should follow: `[GroupName] Anime Name - S##E##.mkv` or `[GroupName] Anime Name S# - ##.mkv`
